MAIN WORK
1.	Using Tinkercad connect an Arduino to three LEDs, Red, Green and Yellow. Connect a resistor of 220 Ohms to each LED. Make sure the Cathode (Negative pin) of the LED is connected to ground. The Anode connects to the resistor. Compose a simple program to light them up in a pattern using Arduino’s digital output.

2.	Using Tinkercad connect an Arduino to six LEDs (two of each colour connected in parallel), Red, Green and Yellow. Connect a resistor of 220 Ohms to the LEDs. Make sure the Cathode (Negative pin) of the LED is connected to ground. The Anode connects to the resistor. Compose a simple program to light them up in a pattern using Arduino’s digital output. Let red LED blink for 5 seconds, the yellow for 2 seconds and the green for 3 seconds.
